===

adc is a tool for managing GCP credentials such as service account keys or user credentials which are used as [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) (ADC) from your application.

With this tool, you will be free from the typical credential management problem: *There are always unknown service account keys in my Downloads folder.*
